# 🚀 Rafael Technical Assessment: React + Tailwind CSS + Vite

## 🌟 Project Overview

In this first coding session my goal is to provide a consistent and responsive markup template that allows me to focus on individual components to be styled and retouched as much as needed to meet the desired design according to the figma file reference.

I also consider important early deploys on a cloud/server to share with my team and clients the work progress and examine the real user experience directly on any device. Besides this allows us to correct any config file and make decisions when including libraries, a particular tech stack or for example any ssr or static type of content in the online version.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite ⚡
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 🎨
- **Deployment**: Vercel 🌐

## 📋 Starter Todo List

- [ ] 🎨 Retouch gradients and colors
- [ ] 🎨 Retouch sizes and proportions
- [ ] 🎨 Optimize images if necessary
- [ ] 🎨 Proposal of animations (conffeti, bubbling coins, etc.)
- [ ] 📦 Optimize bundle size if necessary
- [ ] 📦 Define intermediate resolutions strategy with design and dev team (shrink contents or no, include additional brakepoints or no)
